# Learning Resources

In here I'll be uploading learning resources for programmers from various areas of interest.

## How to learn

- [Digital flashcards](https://ankiweb.net/decks/) <-- learning technique for memorization of bite-sized information.
- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/) <-- free courses to learn how to code with certification that can be put on LinkedIn.

- [Learn the basics on how to use the terminal](https://gitlab.com/slackermedia/bashcrawl) <-- simple text adventure to navigate through terminal commands.

## Books

- Clean Code by Robert C. Martin. [Read it here](https://github.com/jnguyen095/clean-code/blob/master/Clean.Code.A.Handbook.of.Agile.Software.Craftsmanship.pdf)
